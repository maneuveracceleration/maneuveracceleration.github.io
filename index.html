								<h2>What is Maneuver Accelerationism?</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Maneuver Accelerationism is a worldview about man's relationship to reality and a strategy for overcoming and adapting to a rapidly changing environment.</p>
							<p>Effective accelerationism understands the failure of top-down controls on systems, and the inevitability of metaphysically given facts. Ultimately, cause and effect dictates how systems change and develop. On the political level, effective accelerationism sees human force being used to suppress/stop markets as a futile endeavor. However, this is false, because humans could stop markets. Itâ€™s only that stopping markets would destroy us all. Accepting that markets are the way forward, e/acc recognizes the growth of complex systems. As the complexity of these systems grow, they reach the capacity of the human mind and may one day surpass it. Ultimately there is no determination made on the morality of these facts. They are simply facts.</p>
							<p>Maneuver Acceleration, or MAN/acc, makes the moral determination that in all future outcomes, humanity survives.</p>
							<p>Whether the complex systems are friends or foes, humans will be adapted to whatever environment, whatever challenge, whatever task, is required for the survival of the species. We will continue to create more complex systems to deal with the challenging tasks. Currently, the rate of growth for artificial systems surpasses the rate of growth for humans. MAN/acc is a systematic approach towards remedying this inadequacy.</p>
							<p>MAN/acc seeks to create stronger humans. It is a human acceleration project.</p>
							<p>We recognize that there have been both good and bad concepts, and that these concepts have led to different outcomes for not only man, but the project of civilization as a whole. The Maneuver Acceleration project aims to systematically alter the mind of man, as it is the software running on man that will determine the outcome of all future struggle, all conflict. In this way, Maneuver Acceleration is aligned with the transhumanist project.</p>
							<p>Currently it seems that many are worried that the biological substrate of man will not be able to compete with potential artificial adversaries. This fallacy is a product of the belief that conflict is not won through the mind. The outcome of conflict is decided by people, not technology.</p>
							<p>Man's mind has overcome every task that nature has assigned. But this is also not an inevitability. In order to overcome, man must use reason as his primary means of survival. MAN/acc seeks to accelerate that ability to reason, through better reasoning, quicker decisions, and decisive actions. This heightened agency in aggregate will allow a weaker foe to triumph over a stronger foe. Even though man has no claws or fangs, man has maneuvered through every environment that he has chosen to explore. The future will be no different. </p>
							<p>We will maneuver and we will win.</p>
