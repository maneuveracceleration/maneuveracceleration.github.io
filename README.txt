This is Prologue, a simple, single page responsive site template. It features a
clean, minimalistic design and a sticky sidebar with navigation-linked scrolling.

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
